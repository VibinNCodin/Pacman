# Pacman
Pacman clone built with C++

This is my first semester project, honestly it was a bit rushed since i only had about a month and it was my first time, however it came out satisfactory in the end.

Nonetheless, it has alot of issues including,
1) Movement of pacman can be more smoother and less restricting
2) Movement of ghosts is janky
3) Ghosts sometimes appear to be phasing through wall
4) and many more that are less important to mention

Still, i achieved my goal of learning how games can be made, and what is required for making them.
