# Pacman
Pacman clone built with C++ 
(7/12/2023 - 26/12/2023)

You can find the code inside Pacman > Pacman > Pacman.cpp

## Project Overview
This is my first semester project, honestly it was a bit rushed since I only had less than a month and it was my first big project, however it came out satisfactory in the end.

Nonetheless, it has a lot of issues including:
1. Movement of Pacman can be smoother and less restricting.
2. Movement of Ghosts is janky.
3. Ghosts sometimes appear to be phasing through walls.
4. and a few more that are less important to mention.

Still, I achieved my goal of learning how games can be made, and what is required for making them.

## Running the Game
If you want to run the game, you have to do the following steps:
1. Go into the first Pacman folder.
2. Download `Pacman.exe` and `raylib.dll`, and store them into the same folder (name of that folder doesn't matter).
3. Inside the folder you made, create another folder named "assets" (name of this folder DOES matter).
4. Now download all the assets from my folder "assets".
5. Run the `Pacman.exe` and enjoy.

## Feedback and Contributions
Also, give me feedback for improving my coding, or any bad habits that you can recognize from my code.

### Asset Sources
- I used audio from [MyInstants](https://www.myinstants.com) (Starting sound, background sound, winning sound, and losing sound).
- The sprites used in the game were obtained from a source called "Pactiles" (exact URL unknown).

## P.s
I probably wont update this further, but i might try to make a more refined version again after a year.
